Title - Doopee Doo! front end window
What is Doopee Doo!

Doopee Doo! is the Pokemon Go for tourism and Travel. We take users on a quest to discover their region and what makes it unique (food, drinks and local attractions...) and collect rewards along the way. These rewards are collected with a digital loyalty card.

This project is being built as a webapp.

Where does this website come into play? This website is designed to support the commercial aspect of the webapp mentioned above. Whilst the webapp provides a platform to users and businesses to use the digital loyalty card, there is no way for businesses to learn about us and get in touch to acquire new business.

The website covered in this ReadMe will serve as a front end window for potential customers: a sort of first step in the onboarding process to convert a prospect to potential lead by explaining benefits of the product and offering to book a call or message us for more information.

The website is fully responsive and was designed using HTML, CSS and User Centric Design modules.

## 1. User Experience <a name="ux"></a>

### 1.1 Project Goals <a name="project-goals"></a>

#### 1.1.1 User Goals & Expectations <a name="user-goals"></a>
Users of this page are 3 fold: (1)Public Sector representatives such as tourism boards and (2)owners or managers of local independent shops (coffee, food and drinks). (3)A third type of users could be actual users (people) of the digital loyalty card.

Each of this potential users will have different goals, which is why they will be prompted, as the index page to identify the purpose of their visit.

Public Sector Organisations: these organisations are varied. Currently we are reciving interest from tourism boards and public transport (Transport for Wales). Their goals browsing through this website will be to understand the benefits of our product and find a way to get in touch.
Managers and Owners of Local Independent Shops: Typical customers are independent food, drinks and coffee shops. Just like Public Sector Organisation, the goal of these users will be to understand the benefits of the product and find a way to get in touch with us. However, some of the benefits will be different from Public Sector Organisations, which is why the two will be seperated.

People (Users): these are users of the platform for whom the platform is free to access. Therefore, their goal visiting this website will simply to be redirected to the actual platform.

## 2. Design <a name="ui"></a>

### 2.1 Colours <a name="colours"></a>
The main product is aimed at promoting tourism and travel. We find that Studio Ghibli have delivered some very intersting colour palettes as part of their productions.

As a result, we have used a  colour palette inspired from Studio Ghibli to promote the peace of mind of travelling and yet the excitment. This colour palette was found on Pinterest (https://www.pinterest.co.uk/pin/599189925440074430/)

### 2.2 Typography <a name="typography"></a>
Typography will follow the theme taken by the colour pallette, uses fonts that remind users of peace of mind and mysterious adventures.

We have selected Google Fonts, instead of custom fonts, to benefit from better support.
